# RU Maps

This project implements a graph-based mapping system that models locations as vertices and connections as edges. The system supports efficient analysis of routes and connectivity using fundamental graph algorithms.

## Overview
The map is represented as a graph where nodes correspond to locations and weighted edges represent paths between them. This structure enables efficient traversal and route computation, allowing the system to analyze connectivity and determine efficient paths between locations.

## Key Concepts
- Graph representations
- Pathfinding algorithms
- Algorithmic efficiency and correctness
- Data structure design for traversal and analysis

## Functionality
- Construct a graph from input data
- Represent locations and connections as vertices and edges
- Compute efficient routes between locations
- Analyze connectivity between different points in the graph
- Support queries for shortest or fastest paths

## My Contributions
I implemented the core graph representation and pathfinding logic in `RUMaps.java`, focusing on correctness, efficiency, and clean traversal of the graph. This project emphasized reasoning about graph structure, algorithmic trade-offs, and handling edge cases in path computation.
